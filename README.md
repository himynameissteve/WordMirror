Do you remember those Memes which were on the internetz with Obamas Head mirrored from the middle with the text:
Obabo - Presiserp of Unitiu?

This is a program, which takes a sentence and mirrors the first half of each word, except words which are blacklisted (e.g. the, a, and...).
A word has to have a least 3 characters and can contain numbers.
